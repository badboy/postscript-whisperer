# Stack
I would like to revisit the "Hello, World!"-program to highlight an important point. For completeness, here is the source of the "Hello, World!"-program that draws a line on the page.

```ps
{{#include ../../image-src/hello-world.ps:2:4}}
```

A different program that produces the exact same output is shown next

```ps
{{#include ../../image-src/hello-world.alternative.ps:2:5}}
```
