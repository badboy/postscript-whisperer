# What to expect
This book is divided into the following parts

* Introduction
* Tools
* Projects
* Appendices

## Introduction
In the introduction part we will set the scene and talk about the what PostScript is, how it evolved and how it can be used. It will provide some context which will help to make sense of some of the language design decisions.

## Tools
Tools are provided to have a better understanding of what makes PostScript tick.

The chapters are divided along interesting features that can and are used during the projects.

## Projects
Projects are Bob Ross inspired expositions of the capabilities of PostScript. You should be able to dive right into a project, and have a holistic understanding of the tools. When you want to dive deeper into a certain subject, you can fall back onto the tools part. Remember, there are no mistakes, only happy accidents.

The projects are by no means the final destination. They are meant as a inspiration to fuel your own explorations into PostScript. It is literally a blank canvas that invites you to express your creativity. 

## Appendices
The appendices are there to provide context that are not naturally placed within the guide. They can be used as a resource for future studies and sometimes inspiration.
